This project models heat distribution in 2-d space (e.g. if you put a 'hot spot' in one corner, what will the heat distribution look like after 20 time steps). There are two directories, c and fortran, that each include the source code for a functioning heat simulation, as well as a Makefile that provides easy compilation. A `make` command in the home directory will compile both C and Fortran versions, while `make C` and `make Fortran` will compile each version respectively. Both directories include a main program and helper files. In `C`, they are `io_funcs.c` and `update_funcs.c`, which contain source code for helper functions for input/output and heat updates respectively, as well as header files for each of these. In `Fortran`, `io_module.f90` and `update_module.f90` fulfill the same purposes. For convenience, a `make clean` command in the main directory will remove all files except those described above.

Also, to run the executables built, you must include three arguments, in order: input file name, frequency of output file creation, and output file basename. 

Thanks for using this software!
